        <h4>A MOONLIGHTNIGHT</h4>
        <p>
          Settled in the Midwest of Germany "The Astray" is an Indi-Rock Band highly inspired by Bands like Queen, My Chemical Romance, Foo Fighters, Green Day, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Joe.
          But Indi-Rock doesn’t do them justice. With the variety of genres “The Astray” uses and mixes, it is hard to determine a core sound, because with every new Song the Band creates something brand new. That too is the reason why every Song sounds unique and different. The lyrics by Lukas Raschke (Guitarist and Lead Singer) vary around love, pain and metaphorical worlds spoken by an emotional mind and soul. The drums from Jay deliver a strong, metal-influenced core and drive to the mix, together with the foundation set by Leon’s Bass and the Piano from Marco.

            <hr>
            <p>
              What is feeling inside my chest <br>
              It's beating faster, beating faster, it is beating me dead, <br>
              (and) I have a guess <br>
              <br>
              Oh I have met you, some weeks ago <br>
              And I don't know, yeah I don't know, Oh I don't even know, <br>
              your favourite show <br>
              <br>
              And as the time goes past in the blink of an eye <br>
              I'm talking still fast by the of the night <br>
              Cause I need you more than sleep <br>
              <br>
              And as the day goes on and I think of you <br>
              All my worries gone (the) only thing to <br>
              Is to talk to you all night long <br>
              <br>
              You're making me feel big, mountains tall <br>
              You're making me feel special <br>
              All you need is talk and I fade away <br>
              Cause you are making me feel, <br>
              Incredible! <br>
              <br>
              Oh yeah this feeling, don't know it's name <br>
              Cause after all, yeah after all my love is still a game, <br>
            turned on and off <br>
              <br>
              Maybe I'm rushing but that' just me <br>
              But listen close, yeah listen close, oh listen close to me <br>
              To my words <br>
              <br>
              All your flaws are making you better <br>
              If you're cold you can have my sweater <br>
              And in my eyes there could never <br>
              Be someone like you <br>
              <br>
              You're making me feel big, mountains tall <br>
              You're making me feel special <br>
              All you need is talk and I fade away <br>
              Cause you are making me feel <br>
              Incredible! <br>
              Incredible <br>

            <hr>
            <p>
              Run away from your greatest fears <br>
              Wipe away all the wasted tears <br>
              You can't show <br>
              What a show <br>
              <br>
              Hide your face hide you whole despair <br>
              Hide the pain let it disappear <br>
              In your eyes <br>
              In the night <br>
              <br>
              Wander off next to the river but don't go off the moonlit way <br>
              Because oh sweet heartbroken Hunter you are nothing but the prey <br>
              For the demons that are waiting for you luring in the dark <br>
              Waiting for the moment that you lose your last path <br>
              And lose your spark that will never reignite <br>
              The fire never tired of the spark of life <br>
              <br>
              But the demons found their way in your heart <br>
              Pushing you into the flood out of the dark <br>
              And you are drowning drowning sinking to the ground <br>
              But I will get you out out out out out <br>
              I will get you out <br>
              <br>
              Let us get emotional tonight <br>
              Let us believe, let us cry, let us try again <br>
              The irrational high price <br>
              For a moonlight night, a moonlight night <br>
              <br>
              Let me take an oath before you and our ghosts <br>
              That I will not leave your side <br>
              In this moonlight night <br>
              <br>
              And Oh I'm going crazy <br>
              Oh I'm going crazy <br>
              I'm losing my, losing my, losing my mind <br>
              <br>
              And Oh I crave you baby <br>
              Oh I crave you baby <br>
              I crave touch, crave your love, crave your heart <br>
              <br>
              Oh I am sick of it, sick of it <br>
              Sick of swallowing, swallowing <br>y
              All that I'm feeling deep down to my bones <br>
              My heart beats quicker than it's ever been <br>
              The stars are flickering flickering <br>
              And I start to scream! <br>
              <br>
              Let us get emotional tonight <br>
              Let us believe, let us cry, let us try again <br>
              The irrational high price <br>

            <hr>
            <p>
              And oh I'm headed downtown, <br>
              To the places that I love <br>
              The place I once loved <br>
              But they're tainted pink <br>
              <br>
              And oh I'm divin' deep down <br>
              Oh I'm diving to the ground <br>
              And everything that you left to sink <br>
              Is tainted neon pink <br>
              <br>
              And now that we are mixing colours <br>
              And I see you <br>
              With your bloodred lips <br>
              Lick your fingertips <br>
              <br>
              And though I'm always on the run <br>
              I'm running from you <br>
              Because the bittersweet pain <br>
              Stops the deep green paint to drain <br>
              <br>
              And I wear nostalgia as my make up <br>
              Oh there's no chance to make up <br>
              For everything that you left in me, I'm <br>
              Drowning in another cup <br>
              Drown in another love <br>
              That I am painting with my masochistic mastermind <br>
              And when I wear my rose coloured glasses <br>
              I'm seeing rose coloured ashes <br>
              Of the burned down house <br>
              Of our past time vows <br>
              I'm burning in red hot passion <br>
              I haven't learned my lesson <br>
              When you play with fire <br>
              Don't you bring the gasoline <br>
              <br>
              And oh I'm headed downtown, <br>

              And oh I'm, I'm reeking from the chemicals <br>
              That burn me deep down in my bones, in my soul, I <br>
              Can't push you from that pedestal <br>
              That I put you on such long time ago (2x) <br>
              <br>
              And oh I'm headed downtown, <br>

            <h3>Molotov Love</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
              My love is dangerous <br>
              For me and everyone else <br>
              And if you're scared of the dark <br>
              In the night I'm your spark <br>
              To ignite <br>
              Your heart <br>
              <br>
              My heart is venomous <br>
              It is poisened and your heart it is the antidote <br>
              Would you be so generous, give me all your tenderness and I give you everything <br>
              <br>
              And if your love would be a riot, oh then I'd be throwing stones <br>
              If you set the sky on fire, oh then I will light the clouds <br>
              If you gonna bring the chaos you will never be alone <br>
              And we will go on 'til there's noone to dethrone <br>
              <br>
              My love is like a Molotov cocktail on ice <br>
              If it breaks out you should run and hide <br>
              But If wanna play with fire then you gotta come to me <br>
              And If it's that what you desire I'm the match and you're the gasoline <br>
              <br>
              Your love is murderous <br>
              You've poisend me so effortless <br>
              You've got my heart in your hand <br>
              And I can't even tell <br>
              What you want from me <br>
              <br>
              Your love is obnoxious <br>
              But tastes like wine <br>
              With a little bit of poison <br>
              That's what I like <br>
              You are the eternal flame in my everfrost <br>
              And you are melting my heart but at what cost? <br>
              <br>
              Cause, you are setting me free <br>
              But are you sure, <br>
              That you can tame the beast? <br>
              <br>
              My love's a Molotov cocktail on ice <br>
              If it breaks out you should run and hide <br>
              But If wanna play with fire then you gotta come to me <br>
              And If it's that what you desire I'm the match and you the gasoline <br>
              <br>

            <h3>Sleeping Issues</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
              Oh I've been down <br>
              So many bottles <br>
              About to drown <br>
              In my sweet sorrow <br>
              <br>
              And as I slowly got the feels again <br>
              A smile it hit my face my friend <br>
              I think I need help <br>
              And as we're dancing all night long to our favourite song <br>
              I know I must be dreaming because I can't even dance <br>
              <br>
              But I have the right <br>
              Have the right to miss you! <br>
              I have the right to shed a tear when I smell your perfume, but it isn't you <br>
              I have the right to crave your touch <br>
              I have the right to miss you sleeping next to me <br>
              Even though sleeping next to me means I can't sleep myself <br>
              But neither can I without you <br>
              Neither can I without you <br>
              <br>
              Oh and I know I'm not making it better <br>
              I'm making it worse <br>
              But when the remote is stuck on pause <br>
              No applause and nothing but silence after all <br>
              Of course I'll be wanting more <br>
              <br>
              But I am insatiable full of love <br>
              But don't you worry please it's enough in anyway <br>
              Cause you got your problems, so do I <br>
              And I am hard to love because I'm quite the romantic <br>
              That can be overwhelming <br>
              <br>
              But til I can tell you <br>
              <br>
              I have the right <br>
              Have the right to miss you <br>
              I have the right to shed a tear when I smell  your perfume but it isn't you <br>
              I have the right to crave your touch <br>
              I have the right to miss you sleeping next to me even though sleeping next to me means I can't sleep myself <br>
              But neither can I without you <br>
              Neither can I without you <br>

            <h3>Crooked little trees</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
              Long time ago I was pretty proud of myself <br>
              I was pretty proud of myself for one specific reason and you should know that I wasn't very proud of myself that often, what makes this story even sadder. <br>
              So lean back and enjoy <br>
              <br>
              Oh you should picture me, as a teen <br>
              I am crying I will never get a girlfriend <br>
              Seems kinda plausible <br>
              <br>
              There's this girl that I liked <br>
              With her blonde hair and a pretty smile <br>
              Oh her blue eyes <br>
              <br>
              Oh it's the first time I think: <br>
              She has this cute smile but says these smart things! <br>
              She is not just a puppet with a pretty little face <br>
              Not just a statue that I pray to every single day <br>
              Eureka! <br>
              Eureka! I discovered something new! <br>
              Eureka! <br>
              She's a human too <br>
              <br>
              Oh I'm a <br>
              Superficial Individual <br>
              And I don't think that's doing myself good <br>
              It's a <br>
              Pretty vicious, superstition <br>
              Cause noone is as perfect as he looks <br>
              We're all just crooked little trees <br>
              But who the fuck said that we have to be perfect? <br>
              And maybe <br>
              We're pretty <br>
              But pretty is the new fucked up <br>
              <br>
              Oh I have never read much <br>
              But I've listened though <br>
              To all the stories that I got told<br>
              <br>
              And I have learned that <br>
              If you wanna be liked by everyone that you hide yourself <br>
              <br>
              And you become a knight in armor shining bright <br>
              Just a plastic action figure <br>
              They only see your looks so that is what you try, you try to show them what they like <br>
              And after all you get bitter <br>
              After all you get bitter <br>
              And you look, only look on their outsides <br>
              You are shook, yeah you are shook by your own shallowness <br>
              That's what they made you do <br>
              That's what they made you to <br>
              <br>
              And yes yes you are correct to suspect that now normally the chorus would follow but hold up a minute ok? <br>
              Because I know that my mind is pretty poisoned and a little fucked up after all, but it's easy to just say: "It's not my fault!", blame it on society and cry alone while not doing something about it. <br>
              But I wanna do something about it! <br>
              I'm eighteen for gods fucking sake and I don't want to ruin my life before it even started! <br>
              I wanna do something about it and I will! <br>
              Maybe I'll go to therapy and until then hm, maybe I'll will write a few sad songs about how badly I feel but that's ok because I feel. <br>
              Yeah I feel and those emotions want to go out, spread out and live and so do I <br>
              I don't wanna waste my life in my head I ... <br>
              I think I forgot something... oh yeah! <br>
              <br>
              Oh I'm a <br>
              Superficial Individual <br>
              And I don't think that's doing myself good <br>
              It's a <br>
              Pretty vicious, superstition <br>
              Cause noone is as perfect as he looks <br>
              We're all just crooked little trees <br>
              But who the fuck said that we have to be perfect <br>
              And maybe <br>
              We're pretty <br>
              But pretty is the new fucked up <br>

            <h3>Made of Tears</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
              Can you see, the rain is falling on my weary face; <br>
              Surrounded by the cold, trapped at this place <br>
              Im standing here, I’m standing there but I just cannot see <br>
              The friend who can/will release and be the home for me <br>
              <br>
              Tonight the sky is sparkling nice, no darker clouds are seen <br>
              The wind is blowing through the leaves, creating calm and peace	<br>
              But the one is missing, the one is missing who shows me something rife <br>
              The one who’s standing close to me and staying at my side <br>
              <br>
              When the sun goes down, but no moonlight shines <br>
              Take me by the hand, lead me through this night <br>
              Join my way and promise/swear me [ensure me] that you try to keep this lines <br>
              And try to sing along to the song of our lives <br>
              <br>
              As soon as I (just) return home <br>
              I can‘t resist  ´cause now I’m alone <br>
              My feigned mask it starts to fall <br>
              The dusk begins, I‘m forced to crawl/and lets me crawl <br>
              I drown in my tangled mind and my heart it strains to find <br>
              All the cheery things  I left behind <br>
              <br>
              So far I used to spend my time <br>
              For other souls and selling mine <br>
              Such a bleaky place/spot to live (at) <br>
              Where everyone forgives <br>
              You greet my love and my power fades <br>
              My deeds were all betrayed <br>
              Finding the guilt is in vain <br>
              <br>
              I walk through time and barely/hardly mind <br>
              Days and weeks/How weeks are passsing by <br>
              Our music stopped in the dance hall <br>
              We’re dancing at the Dreamers Ball/So take me to the Dreamers Ball <br>
              God, I need you by my side <br>
              I need  my saving light <br> 
              Then again/only then this/the stars are shining bright <br>
              <br>
              But I know I have to let you go <br>
              <br>
              Where are you? <br>
              My Dear <br>
              I lost you <br>
              In our sorrow and our fear <br>
              How are you? <br>
              Do not forget our love/affection <br>
              How we cherished/valued our care and reached the stars above/in love and protection <br>
              <br>
              I miss you/Where are you? <br>
              I dont want us to be apart <br>
